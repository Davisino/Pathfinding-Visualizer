# Pathfinding-Visualizer
Pathfinding Visualizer | Dijkstra's | BFS | DFS
I built this pathfinding vizualizer project to understand more about dijkstra's as well as BFS and DFS work inside and out. Currently, it has only 3 algorithms, but I will continue to add
walls and more stuff. Check it out here: https://pathfinding-visualizer-express.herokuapp.com/
